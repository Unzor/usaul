# usaul
Unzor's simple and useless language

# About
USaul is a programming language designed to test the limits of parsing expression grammar (PEG). It's a useless language that can only parse numbers, mathematical expressions, and only has one function: `log()`. It compiles to JavaScript and its "interpreter" (not really) just compiles the Usaul code to JavaScript and evaluates it.
